      "info":"\n    Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It\u2019s just a little bigger than Earth\u2019s moon.\n    It is the closest planet to the sun, but it\u2019s actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter.\n    Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets.\n    It has a solid surface that is covered with craters. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn\u2019t have any moons.\n    Mercury likes to keep things simple. This small planet spins around slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time.\n    Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation. A year on Mercury goes by fast.\n    Because it\u2019s the closest planet to the sun, it doesn\u2019t take very long to go all the way around.\n    It completes one revolution around the sun in just 88 Earth days. If you lived on Mercury, you\u2019d have a birthday every three months!\n    A day on Mercury is not like a day here on Earth. For us, the sun rises and sets each and every day.\n    Because Mercury has a slow spin and short year, it takes a long time for the sun to rise and set there.\n    Mercury only has one sunrise every 180 Earth days! Isn't that weird?",

      "info":"Even though Venus isn't the closest planet to the sun, it is still the hottest.\nIt has a thick atmosphere full of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and clouds made of sulfuric acid.\nThe gas traps heat and keeps Venus toasty warm.\nIn fact, it's so hot on Venus, metals like lead would be puddles of melted liquid.\nVenus looks like a very active planet.\nIt has mountains and volcanoes.\nVenus is similar in size to Earth.\nEarth is just a little bit bigger.\nVenus is unusual because it spins the opposite direction of Earth and most other planets.\nAnd its rotation is very slow.\nIt takes about 243 Earth days to spin around just once.\nBecause it's so close to the sun, a year goes by fast.\nIt takes 225 Earth days for Venus to go all the way around the sun. \nThat means that a day on Venus is a little longer than a year on Venus.\nSince the day and year lengths are similar, one day on Venus is not like a day on Earth. \nHere, the sun rises and sets once each day. \nBut on Venus, the sun rises every 117 Earth days. \nThat means the sun rises two times during each year on Venus,\neven though it is still the same day on Venus! \nAnd because Venus rotates backwards, the sun rises in the west and sets in the east.\nJust like Mercury, Venus doesn\u2019t have any moons.",
